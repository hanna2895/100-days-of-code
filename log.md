# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on landing page for my capstone project, using React and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Using React CSS is challenging, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I also don't have the greatest eye for design, so I've started making lists of websites that I like and then incorporating design features I like from each of them into my work.

### Day 2: Tuesday, June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to deploy my Rails back end to Heroku.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't get this to work today, which is frustrating. The error I'm getting is related to Heroku Postgres not being able to use my relations or migrations, but I'll keep working on it.

### Day 3: Wednesday, June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got my back end deployed!

**Thoughts** Thank god for crowdsourcing and my GA cohort. It would definitely have taken me at least another few days to figure out why this wasn't working. (You can't have belongs_to :through in rails. Which I knew, but apparently typed anyway.)
