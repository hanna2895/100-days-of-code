# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on landing page for my capstone project, using React and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Using React CSS is challenging, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I also don't have the greatest eye for design, so I've started making lists of websites that I like and then incorporating design features I like from each of them into my work.

### Day 2: Tuesday, June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to deploy my Rails back end to Heroku.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't get this to work today, which is frustrating. The error I'm getting is related to Heroku Postgres not being able to use my relations or migrations, but I'll keep working on it.

### Day 3: Wednesday, June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got my back end deployed!

**Thoughts** Thank god for crowdsourcing and my GA cohort. It would definitely have taken me at least another few days to figure out why this wasn't working. (You can't have belongs_to :through in rails. Which I knew, but apparently typed anyway.)

### Day 4: Thursday, June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I deployed my front end to Heroku, updated my portfolio site to reflect my latest project, and continued to work on the landing page of my site.

**Thoughts:** I'm staring to get the hang of deploying to Heroku on my own, although it would be nice to have a good guide. It also helps when you actually have your package.json at the root level, which I did not. Plus, I'm getting better at React CSS, which is exciting.

### Day 5: Friday, June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the back end of my site and researched AWS S3 and other cloud-based data storage options to store files as the application scales.

**Thoughts:** I have a lot more work to do on this, apparently.

### Day 6: Saturday, June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on storing files in the postgreSQL database using form data and params. Not making a lot of progress.

**Thoughts:** This seems like it should be easier than it is. I need to do some more research.

### Day 7: Sunday, June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Might be getting closer with the file uploads? I also picked up the MyCanvas Spotify OAuth project again to keep building in Express, but the page keeps refreshing and there are some new challenges in pulling data after OAuth occurs.

**Thoughts:** I switched from params back to using payload, but I'm still stuck at wrong number of arguments. Will start over with a new model / table / controller and see if that helps, but I'm not hopeful.

### Day 8: Monday, June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm finishing up the styling on ABC training today so I can at least feel like I'm making progress.

**Thoughts:** React CSS is annoying but slow progress is better than no progress.

### Day 9: Tuesday, June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling the landing page of ABC training and adjusted the nav bar so it doesn't mess up the content once you actually log into the app. I also updated the readmes for some of my old projects to make my github look nice.

**Thoughts:** It may be slightly overboard, but I was having fun / procrastinating.

### Day 10: Wednesday, June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up some last minute styling and functionality issues to get ready for our S H O W C A S E today (so excited!)

**Thoughts:** I can't wait to start working on functionality again but I'm too scared to break something before I have to present it to employers.

### Skipped Thursday, June 14. (from the 1st 14-day block).

### Day 11: Friday, June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started refactoring my React code in ABC training to Redux in order to make the app cleaner.

**Thoughts:** You have to put that stuff in the root reducer. It took me an hour to figure out why it wasn't working, but now I'll know.

### Day 12: Saturday, June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Moved the get admins function from React component into Redux.

**Thoughts:** I thought this would be easy but it required some playing around with React Lifecycle methods and some if/else logic that was tough to figure out.

### Day 13: Sunday, June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I moved the EditAdmins function over from my React component into Redux.

**Thoughts:** Lol at how I thought this would be easy. Lots more playing with React Lifecycle components, and adding the store to more components, refactoring dumb components into smart components, etc.

### Day 14: Monday, June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished moving the admin component over into Redux.

### Day 15: Tuesday, June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started moving the student component over into Redux.

**Thoughts:** For some reason, the action isn't being called. I'm not sure why, but it's not updating properly.

### Day 16: Friday, June 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got the photos to show up on the user show page of MyCanvas.

**Thoughts:** I missed a few days, and switched back to MyCanvas to keep studying for a MERN stack interview I have on Monday. Turns out, I forgot to actually put stuff in my Photo schema.
